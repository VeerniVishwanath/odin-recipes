  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 dash salt</li>
    <li>1 dash ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 dash garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 green onions - chopped, green and white parts separated, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups diced cooked chicken breast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon soy-based liquid seasoning (such as Maggi®), or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>ounces butter chicken cooking sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 6 cups of a
      muffin tin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir sugar, salt, cumin, and garlic powder into the melted butter in a
      bowl. Add flour slowly, mixing until moist but not sticky; you should be
      able to manipulate it with your hands.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate tart dough into 6 sections; roll each into a ball and flatten
      into a round in your hand. Press into the prepared muffin cups.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>
      While crusts are baking, heat oil over medium-high heat in a skillet.
      Saute onion and white sections of green onions in the hot oil until just
      starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken, soy-based liquid
      seasoning, salt, and pepper; saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter chicken
      sauce and cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Spoon butter chicken mixture into the baked tart shells.</li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove
      tarts from tin using a butter knife and tongs. Sprinkle green sections of
      green onions on top.
    </li>
  </ol>
